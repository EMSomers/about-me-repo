                    <h2>The Great Outdoors</h2>
                    <p> Growing up my mom always told me that she had done enough camping in her life time and was done
                        with
                        it. I honestly didn't believe that she had even been camping! I tried car-camping a few times
                        with
                        friends and it always seemed like such a strange concept. You drive to a big park where if
                        you're
                        lucky a thin line of trees seperates your campsite from the next. It honestly felt worse than
                        living
                        in a subdivision to me. When I first met my partner neither of us had really been back-country
                        camping, but one year he decided to buy a canoe with his friend which opened a whole new passion
                        for
                        both of us. The first trip we went on the three of us, me- my partner - and his friend, piled
                        into
                        the canoe with random bits of camp gear we though might be handy and paddled down a river to
                        what we
                        now call "bing-bong bay". We honestly weren't sure of where we were going or what it would be
                        like
                        but it was one of the best adventures to enjoy together. Since then we have been able to explore
                        Northern Ontario and have grown to be very confident in our outdoor skills. </p>
