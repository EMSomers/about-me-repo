                        Big Floofy Cats
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I never thought I was a "cat person" but when my partner and I first moved into our house I
                        really
                        wanted a pet. I was leaning towards a dog but he insisted cats were low maintenance and would be
                        a
                        good first pet for us. We now have two big floof balls that I couldn't love more. They have such
                        distinct personalities, they shed as much as a dog would but they don't jump on people! They're
                        both
                        part Maine Coon which means they are just bigger than your average house cat and have a few
                        funny
                        quirks. Darwin loves water! The second you head towards the bathtub suddenly its a race that he
                        is
                        determined to win. Mortimer is incredibly shy, when we first brought him home he mostly just hid
                        under our cabinets and would never let you get too close for pets or cuddles. After a lot of
                        effort
                        and patience he has learnt that he secretly likes to cuddle, as long as its on his terms!
